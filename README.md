                                     🔐 Project Title: Login Authentication System
📘 Description:

The Login Authentication System is a secure web-based application designed to validate user credentials before granting access to protected areas of a website or web app. It implements a simple yet effective front-end login interface that collects the user’s email and password, securely transmits them to a backend API (or mock server), and provides real-time feedback based on the authentication response.

This system forms the foundation of most secure web applications and can be extended with registration, password recovery, or two-factor authentication modules.

💡 Uniqueness:

Interactive UI with Real-Time Feedback — Users instantly see whether their login attempt succeeded or failed.

Password Visibility Toggle — Enhances user experience by allowing them to view or hide their password.

Frontend Security Measures — Basic input validation ensures no empty credentials are submitted.

Ready for Integration — The system is designed to easily connect to a backend API for real-world authentication.

Modern UI/UX Design — Built using responsive design principles with CSS gradients, rounded corners, and subtle shadows for a professional look.

⚙️ Features:

User Login Form

API Integration (Placeholder)
