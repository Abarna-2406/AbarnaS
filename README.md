                                      Project Title: Login Authentication System
 Description:

The Login Authentication System is a secure web-based application designed to validate user credentials before granting access to protected areas of a website or web app. It implements a simple yet effective front-end login interface that collects the user’s email and password, securely transmits them to a backend API (or mock server), and provides real-time feedback based on the authentication response.

This system forms the foundation of most secure web applications and can be extended with registration, password recovery, or two-factor authentication modules.

 Uniqueness:

Interactive UI with Real-Time Feedback — Users instantly see whether their login attempt succeeded or failed.

Password Visibility Toggle — Enhances user experience by allowing them to view or hide their password.

Frontend Security Measures — Basic input validation ensures no empty credentials are submitted.

Ready for Integration — The system is designed to easily connect to a backend API for real-world authentication.

Modern UI/UX Design — Built using responsive design principles with CSS gradients, rounded corners, and subtle shadows for a professional look.

 Features:

User Login Form

Email and password input fields.

Mandatory input validation.

Password Show/Hide Functionality

Users can toggle between visible and hidden password states.

API Integration (Placeholder)

The script is prepared to send data to a backend authentication endpoint (fetch() with JSON body).

Login Feedback Messages

Displays success or failure messages dynamically.

Automatic Redirection

On successful login, the system stores an authentication token in localStorage and redirects to a dashboard.

Responsive Design

Centered authentication form, adaptable to all screen sizes.

 Technologies Used:

HTML5 – Structure and form design.

CSS3 – Styling and layout (gradient background, card design).

JavaScript (ES6) – Functionality for validation, API calls, and interactivity.
